Hi 👋 My name is Hilary Gould
Full Stack Developer
I've worked in SaaS for about 5 years at companies ranging from pre venture funding to publicly traded. While working in Customer Success, I discovered my love of technical problem solving. I decided to enroll at @launchacademy to further develop my technical skills.

🌍  I'm based in Boston
